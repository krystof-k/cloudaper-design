# Design system

The result of the whole design process is the product. The product is when we combine the *form* and the *content*. It's therefore crucial to consider the content as a part of the design process as well.

We can define a basic schema of the design process:

```
        Form         	Content
          ↓          	   ↓
Application of a form
          ↓          	   ↓
        Code
          ↓          	   ↓
       Product     ←
```

Each phase of the design process – which we can understand also as a design layer – can be made of several parts (eg. form is shaped by brand and principles). Each phase or part should be specified by certain styleguide (or even multiple ones), which may overlap with the other phases (for example naming is relevant to all phases).

## Design phases & styleguides

*Work in progress.*

Just a brainstorming of all possible styleguides for now:

- [Brand guidelines](styleguides/brand-guidelines.md)
- [Principles](styleguides/principles.md)
- Front-end styleguide
- Application styleguides *(yes, multiples)*
- *Code styleguides / conventions*
  - [Naming](styleguides/naming.md)
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript (React)
  - Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
- *Content*
  - Writing styleguide *(eg. for print materials, blogposts, …)*
  - Voice & tone
